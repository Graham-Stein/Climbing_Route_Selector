### Climbing Guide Books

Build an app which allows a climber to choose the right route for the them. Routes are already described in a series of guide books, but it is difficult to search the books on useful criteria.  

#### MVP

* The app should allow saving of routes on the basis of name, summer grade, winter grade, length, aspect, and elevation.
* The app should allow viewing of routes on the basis of guide-books, crag.
* You should be able to create, edit and delete routes and crags separately.
* Show a crags page, listing all the crags in a guide-book or all the crags in multiple guide-books in single view.


#### Possible Extensions

* Search by route name.
* Filter the crags by aspect.
* Filter routes by grade.
* Filter crags by location N/S and E/W
* Add 'classic rock' and 'cold climbs' status to routes and allow filtering on that basis.
* Ensure filtering is possible on all filters simultaneously.
